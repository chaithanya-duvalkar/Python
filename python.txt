oops in python
-to map with real world scenarios, we use objects in code
-this is oops

-by using functions the code resuability increases and code redundancy decreases

class and object in python
-class is a blueprint for creating objects

_init_ functions
-contsructor-All classes have a function called _intit_(),which is always executed
when the class is being initiated.
-self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables
that belongs to the class

methods
-methods are functions that belong to objects

static methods
-methods that don't use the self parameter(work at class level)
-decorators allow us to wrap another fucntion in order to extend the behaviour of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it

Abstraction
-hiding the implementation details of a class and only showing the essential features to the user

Encapsulation
-wrapping data and functions into a single unit(object)

del keyword
-used to delete object properties or object itself
del s1.name
del name

private(like) attributes and methods
-used only within the class and are not accessible from outside the class

inheritance
-dervies the ppties and methods of another class

types of inheritance
-single
-multi-level 
-multiple

super method 
-access methods of the parent class

polymorphism
-when the same operator is allowed to have diff meaning according to the context
operator overloading
